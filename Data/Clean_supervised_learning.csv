0,  What is Linear Regression Algorithm?,"In simple terms: It is a method of finding the best straight line fitting to the given dataset, i.e. tries to find the best linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.In technical terms: It is a supervised machine learning algorithm that finds the best linear-fit relationship on the given dataset, between independent and dependent variables. It is mostly done with the help of the Sum of Squared Residuals Method, known as the Ordinary least squares (OLS) method.                                                       Image Source: Google Images ",linear regress
1,  How do you interpret a linear regression model?,"As we know that the linear regression model is of the form:The significance of the linear regression model lies in the fact that we can easily interpret and understand the marginal changes in the independent variables(predictors) and observed their consequences on the dependent variable(response).Therefore, a linear regression model is quite easy to interpret.For Example, if we increase the value of x1 increases by 1 unit, keeping other variables constant, then the total increase in the value of y will be βi and the intercept term (β0) is the response when all the predictor’s terms are set to zero or not considered.",interpret linear regress
2,  What are the basic assumptions of the Linear Regression Algorithm?,"The basic assumptions of the Linear regression algorithm are as follows: Linearity: The relationship between the features and target. Homoscedasticity: The error term has a constant variance. Multicollinearity: There is no multicollinearity between the features. Independence: Observations are independent of each other. Normality: The error(residuals) follows a normal distribution. Now, let’s break these assumptions into different categories:It is assumed that there exists a linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Sometimes, this assumption is known as the ‘linearity assumption’. Normality assumption: The error terms, ε(i), are normally distributed. Zero mean assumption: The residuals have a mean value of zero. Constant variance assumption: The residual terms have the same (but unknown) value of variance, σ2. This assumption is also called the assumption of homogeneity or homoscedasticity. Independent error assumption: The residual terms are independent of each other, i.e. their pair-wise covariance value is zero.  The independent variables are measured without error. There does not exist a linear dependency between the independent variables, i.e. there is no multicollinearity in the data. ",assumpt linear regress
3,  Explain the difference between Correlation and Regression.,Correlation: It measures the strength or degree of relationship between two variables. It doesn’t capture causality. It is visualized by a single point.Regression: It measures how one variable affects another variable. Regression is all about model fitting. It tries to capture the causality and describes the cause and the effect. It is visualized by a regression line.,correl regress
4,  Explain the Gradient Descent algorithm with respect to linear regression.,"Gradient descent is a first-order optimization algorithm. In linear regression, this algorithm is used to optimize the cost function to find the values of the βs (estimators) corresponding to the optimized value of the cost function.The working of Gradient descent is similar to a ball that rolls down a graph (ignoring the inertia). In that case, the ball moves along the direction of the maximum gradient and comes to rest at the flat surface i.e, corresponds to minima.Mathematically, the main objective of the gradient descent for linear regression is to find the solution of the following expression,ArgMin J(θ0, θ1), where J(θ0, θ1) represents the cost function of the linear regression. It is given by :Here, h is the linear hypothesis model, defined as h=θ0 + θ1x,y is the target column or output, and m is the number of data points in the training set.Step-1: Gradient Descent starts with a random solution,Step-2: Based on the direction of the gradient, the solution is updated to the new value where the cost function has a lower value.The updated value for the parameter is given by the formulae:Repeat until convergence(upto minimum loss function)",descent gradient linear regress
5,  Justify the cases where the linear regression algorithm is suitable for a given dataset.,"Generally, a Scatter plot is used to see if linear regression is suitable for any given data. So, we can go for a linear model if the relationship looks somewhat linear. Plotting the scatter plots is easy in the case of simple or univariate linear regression.But if we have more than one independent variable i.e, the case of multivariate linear regression, then two-dimensional pairwise scatter plots, rotating plots, and dynamic graphs can be plotted to find the suitableness.On the contrary, to make the relationship linear we have to apply some transformations.",case dataset justifi linear regress suitabl

7,"  For a linear regression model, how do we interpret a Q-Q plot?","The Q-Q plot represents a graphical plotting of the quantiles of two distributions with respect to each other. In simple words, we plot quantiles against quantiles in the Q-Q plot which is used to check the normality of errors.Whenever we interpret a Q-Q plot, we should concentrate on the ‘y = x’ line, which corresponds to a normal distribution. Sometimes, this line is also known as the 45-degree line in statistics.It implies that each of the distributions has the same quantiles. In case you witness a deviation from this line, one of the distributions could be skewed when compared to the other i.e, normal distribution.",interpret linear plot q q regress
8,"  In linear regression, what is the value of the sum of the residuals for a given dataset? Explain with proper justification.","The sum of the residuals in a linear regression model is 0 since it assumes that the errors (residuals) are normally distributed with an expected value or mean equal to 0, i.e.Y = βT X + εHere, Y is the dependent variable or the target column, and β is the vector of the estimates of the regression coefficient,X is the feature matrix containing all the features as the columns, ε is the residual term such that ε ~ N(0, σ2).Moreover, the sum of all the residuals is calculated as the expected value of the residuals times the total number of observations in our dataset.

9,  What are RMSE and MSE? How to calculate it?,"RMSE and MSE are the two of the most common measures of accuracy for linear regression.MSE (Mean Squared Error) is defined as the average of all the squared errors(residuals) for all data points. In simple words, we can say it is an average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is the square root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.RMSE stands for Root mean square error, which represented by the formulae:MSE stands for Mean square error, which represented by the formulae:Increment in RMSE is larger than MAE as the test sample size increases. In general, as the variance of error magnitudes increase, MAE remains steady but RMSE increases.",calcul mse rmse
10,  What is OLS?,"OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares. The main objective of the linear regression algorithm is to find coefficients or estimates by minimizing the error term i.e, the sum of squared errors. This process is known as OLS.This method finds the best fit line, known as regression line by minimizing the sum of square differences between the observed and predicted values.",ol
11,  What are MAE and MAPE?,"MAE stands for Mean Absolute Error, which is defined as the average of absolute or positive errors of all values.

14,  Which evaluation metric should you prefer to use for a dataset having a lot of outliers in it?,"Mean Absolute Error(MAE) is preferred when we have too many outliers present in the dataset because MAE is robust to outliers whereas MSE and RMSE are very susceptible to outliers and these start penalizing the outliers by squaring the error terms, commonly known as residuals.",dataset evalu lot metric outlier prefer use
15,  Explain the normal form equation of the linear regression.,"The normal equation for linear regression is :β=(XTX)-1XTYThis is also known as the closed-form solution for a linear regression model.where,Y=βTX is the equation that represents the model for the linear regression,Y is the dependent variable or target column,β is the vector of the estimates of the regression coefficient, which is arrived at using the normal equation,X is the feature matrix that contains all the features in the form of columns. The thing to note down here is that the first column in the X matrix consists of all 1s, to incorporate the offset value for the regression line.",equat form linear normal regress
16,  When should it be preferred to the Gradient Descent method instead of the Normal Equation in Linear Regression Algorithm?,"To answer the given question, let’s first understand the difference between the Normal equation and Gradient descent method for linear regression: Needs hyper-parameter tuning for alpha (learning parameter). It is an iterative process. Time complexity- O(kn2) Preferred when n is extremely large.  No such need for any hyperparameter. It is a non-iterative process. Time complexity- O(n3) due to evaluation of XTX. Becomes quite slow for large values of n. where,‘k’ represents the maximum number of iterations used for the gradient descent algorithm, and‘n’ is the total number of observations present in the training dataset.Clearly, if we have large training data, a normal equation is not preferred for use due to very high time complexity but for small values of ‘n’, the normal equation is faster than gradient descent.",descent equat gradient instead linear method normal prefer regress
17,  What are R-squared and Adjusted R-squared?,"R-square (R2), also known as the coefficient of determination measures the proportion of the variation in your dependent variable (Y) explained by your independent variables (X) for a linear regression model.The main problem with the R-squared is that it will always remain the same or increases as we are adding more independent variables. Therefore, to overcome this problem, an Adjusted-R2 square comes into the picture by penalizing those adding independent variables that do not improve your existing model.To learn more about, R2 and adjusted-R2, refer to the link.",adjust r r squar squar
18,  What are the flaws in R-squared?,"There are two major flaws of R-squared:Problem- 1: As we are adding more and more predictors, R² always increases irrespective of the impact of the predictor on the model. As R² always increases and never decreases, it can always appear to be a better fit with the more independent variables(predictors) we add to the model. This can be completely misleading.Problem- 2: Similarly, if our model has too many independent variables and too many high-order polynomials, we can also face the problem of over-fitting the data. Whenever the data is over-fitted, it can lead to a misleadingly high R² value which eventually can lead to misleading predictions.To learn more about, flaws of R2, refer to the link.",flaw r squar
19,  What is Multicollinearity?,"It is a phenomenon where two or more independent variables(predictors) are highly correlated with each other i.e. one variable can be linearly predicted with the help of other variables. It determines the inter-correlations and inter-association among independent variables. Sometimes, multicollinearity can also be known as collinearity.                                                       Image Source: Google Images Inaccurate use of dummy variables.

How to detect it?,"It refers to the situation where the variations in a particular independent variable are unequal across the range of values of a second variable that tries to predict it.                                                            Image Source: Google ImagesTo detect heteroscedasticity, we can use graphs or statistical tests such as the Breush-Pagan test and NCV test, etc.",detect heteroscedast
21,  What are the disadvantages of the linear regression Algorithm?,"The main disadvantages of linear regression are as follows: Assumption of linearity: It assumes that there exists a linear relationship between the independent variables(input) and dependent variables (output), therefore we are not able to fit the complex problems with the help of a linear regression algorithm. Outliers: It is sensitive to noise and outliers. Multicollinearity: It gets affected by multicollinearity. ",disadvantag linear regress
22,  What is VIF? How do you calculate it?,"VIF stands for Variance inflation factor, which measures how much variance of an estimated regression coefficient is increased due to the presence of collinearity between the variables. It also determines how much multicollinearity exists in a particular regression model.Firstly, it applies the ordinary least square method of regression that has Xi as a function of all the other explanatory or independent variables and then calculates VIF using the given below mathematical formula:",calcul vif
23,  Is it possible to apply Linear Regression for Time Series Analysis?,"Yes, we can apply a linear regression algorithm for doing analysis on time series data, but the results are not promising and hence is not advisable to do so.The reasons behind not preferable linear regression on time-series data are as follows: Time series data is mostly used for the prediction of the future but in contrast, linear regression generally seldom gives good results for future prediction as it is basically not meant for extrapolation. Moreover, time-series data have a pattern, such as during peak hours, festive seasons, etc., which would most likely be treated as outliers in the linear regression analysis.

To check this relationship, a scatter plot proves to be useful.Secondly, there must no or very little multi-collinearity between the independent variables in the dataset. The value needs to be restricted, which depends on the domain requirement.The third is the homoscedasticity. It is one of the most important assumptions which states that the errors are equally distributed.",assumpt import linear regress

26,  What is the difference between R square and adjusted R square?,"R square and adjusted R square values are used for model validation in case of linear regression. R square indicates the variation of all the independent variables on the dependent variable. i.e. it considers all the independent variable to explain the variation. In the case of Adjusted R squared, it considers only significant variables(P values less than 0.05) to indicate the percentage of variation in the model.",adjust r r squar squar

28,  What are the possible ways of improving the accuracy of a linear regression model?,"There could be multiple ways of improving the accuracy of a linear regression, most commonly used ways are as follows:-Regression is sensitive to outliers, hence it becomes very important to treat the outliers with appropriate values.

33,  What is the use of regularisation? Explain L1 and L2 regularisations.,"Regularisation is a technique that is used to tackle the problem of overfitting of the model. When a very complex model is implemented on the training data, it overfits. At times, the simple model might not be able to generalise the data and the complex model overfits. To address this problem, regularisation is used.  Regularisation is nothing but adding the coefficient terms (betas) to the cost function so that the terms are penalised and are small in magnitude. This essentially helps in capturing the trends in the data and at the same time prevents overfitting by not letting the model become too complex. ",l1 l2 regularis regularis use
34,  How to choose the value of the parameter learning rate (α)?,"Selecting the value of learning rate is a tricky business. If the value is too small, the gradient descent algorithm takes ages to converge to the optimal solution. On the other hand, if the value of the learning rate is high, the gradient descent will overshoot the optimal solution and most likely never converge to the optimal solution. To overcome this problem, you can try different values of alpha over a range of values and plot the cost vs the number of iterations. Then, based on the graphs, the value corresponding to the graph showing the rapid decrease can be chosen.  The aforementioned graph is an ideal cost vs the number of iterations curve. Note that the cost initially decreases as the number of iterations increases, but after certain iterations, the gradient descent converges and the cost does not decrease anymore.  If you see that the cost is increasing with the number of iterations, your learning rate parameter is high and it needs to be decreased. ",choos learn paramet rate valu α
35,  How to choose the value of the regularisation parameter (λ)?,"Selecting the regularisation parameter is a tricky business. If the value of λ is too high, it will lead to extremely small values of the regression coefficient β, which will lead to the model underfitting (high bias – low variance). On the other hand, if the value of λ is 0 (very small), the model will tend to overfit the training data (low bias – high variance). There is no proper way to select the value of λ. What you can do is have a sub-sample of data and run the algorithm multiple times on different sets. Here, the person has to decide how much variance can be tolerated. Once the user is satisfied with the variance, that value of λ can be chosen for the full dataset.  One thing to be noted is that the value of λ selected here was optimal for that subset, not for the entire training data. ",choos paramet regularis valu λ

37,  What value is the sum of the residuals of a linear regression close to? Justify.,"Ans The sum of the residuals of a linear regression is 0. Linear regression works on the assumption that the errors (residuals) are normally distributed with a mean of 0, i.e. Y = βT X + εHere, Y is the target or dependent variable,  β is the vector of the regression coefficient, X is the feature matrix containing all the features as the columns,  ε is the residual term such that ε ~ N(0,σ2).  So, the sum of all the residuals is the expected value of the residuals times the total number of data points. Since the expectation of residuals is 0, the sum of all the residual terms is zero.  Note: N(μ,σ2) is the standard notation for a normal distribution having mean μ and standard deviation σ2.",close justifi linear regress residu sum valu
38,  How does multicollinearity affect the linear regression?,"Ans Multicollinearity occurs when some of the independent variables are highly correlated (positively or negatively) with each other. This multicollinearity causes a problem as it is against the basic assumption of linear regression. The presence of multicollinearity does not affect the predictive capability of the model. So, if you just want predictions, the presence of multicollinearity does not affect your output. However, if you want to draw some insights from the model and apply them in, let’s say, some business model, it may cause problems. One of the major problems caused by multicollinearity is that it leads to incorrect interpretations and provides wrong insights. The coefficients of linear regression suggest the mean change in the target value if a feature is changed by one unit. So, if multicollinearity exists, this does not hold true as changing one feature will lead to changes in the correlated variable and consequent changes in the target variable. This leads to wrong insights and can produce hazardous results for a business.  A highly effective way of dealing with multicollinearity is the use of VIF (Variance Inflation Factor). Higher the value of VIF for a feature, more linearly correlated is that feature. Simply remove the feature with very high VIF value and re-train the model on the remaining dataset.

What could be the issue here?","This case implies that the dataset is heterogeneous.

41,  What do you mean by adjusted R2? How is it different from R2?,"Adjusted R2, just like R2, is a representative of the number of points lying around the regression line. That is, it shows how well the model is fitting the training data. The formula for adjusted R2  is —   Here, n is the number of data points, and k is the number of features. One drawback of R2 is that it will always increase with the addition of a new feature, whether the new feature is useful or not. The adjusted R2 overcomes this drawback. The value of the adjusted R2 increases only if the newly added feature plays a significant role in the model.",adjust differ mean r2 r2
42,  How do you interpret the residual vs fitted value curve?,"The residual vs fitted value plot is used to see whether the predicted values and residuals have a correlation or not. If the residuals are distributed normally, with a mean around the fitted value and a constant variance, our model is working fine; otherwise, there is some issue with the model. The most common problem that can be found when training the model over a large range of a dataset is heteroscedasticity(this is explained in the answer below). The presence of heteroscedasticity can be easily seen by plotting the residual vs fitted value curve.",curv fit interpret residu v valu
43,"  What is heteroscedasticity? What are the consequences, and how can you overcome it?","A random variable is said to be heteroscedastic when different subpopulations have different variabilities (standard deviation).  The existence of heteroscedasticity gives rise to certain problems in the regression analysis as the assumption says that error terms are uncorrelated and, hence, the variance is constant. The presence of heteroscedasticity can often be seen in the form of a cone-like scatter plot for residual vs fitted values.  One of the basic assumptions of linear regression is that heteroscedasticity is not present in the data. Due to the violation of assumptions, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators are not the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). Hence, they do not give the least variance than other Linear Unbiased Estimators (LUEs). There is no fixed procedure to overcome heteroscedasticity. However, there are some ways that may lead to a reduction of heteroscedasticity. They are — ",consequ heteroscedast overcom

If the value of VIF is high for a variable, it implies that the R2  value of the corresponding model is high, i.e. other independent variables are able to explain that variable. In simple terms, the variable is linearly dependent on some other variables.",calcul vif

The update is: Repeat until convergence ",descent gradient linear regress
47,  What is robust regression?,"A regression model should be robust in nature. This means that with changes in a few observations, the model should not change drastically. Also, it should not be much affected by the outliers.  A regression model with OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) is quite sensitive to the outliers. To overcome this problem, we can use the WLS (Weighted Least Squares) method to determine the estimators of the regression coefficients. Here, less weights are given to the outliers or high leverage points in the fitting, making these points less impactful. ",regress robust
48,  Which graphs are suggested to be observed before model fitting?,"Before fitting the model, one must be well aware of the data, such as what the trends, distribution, skewness, etc. in the variables are. Graphs such as histograms, box plots, and dot plots can be used to observe the distribution of the variables. Apart from this, one must also analyse what the relationship between dependent and independent variables is. This can be done by scatter plots (in case of univariate problems), rotating plots, dynamic plots, etc.",fit graph observ suggest
49,  What is the generalized linear model?,The generalized linear model is the derivative of the ordinary linear regression model. GLM is more flexible in terms of residuals and can be used where linear regression does not seem appropriate. GLM allows the distribution of residuals to be other than a normal distribution. It generalizes the linear regression by allowing the linear model to link to the target variable using the linking function. Model estimation is done using the method of maximum likelihood estimation.,gener linear
50,  Explain the bias-variance trade-off.,"Bias refers to the difference between the values predicted by the model and the real values. It is an error. One of the goals of an ML algorithm is to have a low bias. Variance refers to the sensitivity of the model to small fluctuations in the training dataset. Another goal of an ML algorithm is to have low variance. For a dataset that is not exactly linear, it is not possible to have both bias and variance low at the same time. A straight line model will have low variance but high bias, whereas a high-degree polynomial will have low bias but high variance. There is no escaping the relationship between bias and variance in machine learning.So, there is a trade-off between the two; the ML specialist has to decide, based on the assigned problem, how much bias and variance can be tolerated. Based on this, the final model is built.",bia trade varianc
51,  How can learning curves help create a better model?,"Learning curves give the indication of the presence of overfitting or underfitting.  In a learning curve, the training error and cross-validating error are plotted against the number of training data points. A typical learning curve looks like this:  If the training error and true error (cross-validating error) converge to the same value and the corresponding value of the error is high, it indicates that the model is underfitting and is suffering from high bias.  If there is a significant gap between the converging values of the training and cross-validating errors, i.e. the cross-validating error is significantly higher than the training error, it suggests that the model is overfitting the training data and is suffering from a high variance.

This is just like our simple logistic regression, where we use a logit function to generate a probability between 0 and 1.So, what’s the difference between the two?Simply put, it is just the difference in the threshold function!

54,"  What if we do not use any activation function(s) in a neural network?
","The main aim of this question is to understand why we need activation functions in a neural network. You can start off by giving a simple explanation of how neural networks are built:Step 1: Calculate the sum of all the inputs (X) according to their weights and include the bias term:Z = (weights * X) + biasStep 2: Apply an activation function to calculate the expected output:Y = Activation(Z)Steps 1 and 2 are performed at each layer. If you recollect, this is nothing but forward propagation! Now, what if there is no activation function?Our equation for Y essentially becomes:Y = Z = (weights * X) + biasWait – isn’t this just a simple linear equation? Yes – and that is why we need activation functions. A linear equation will not be able to capture the complex patterns in the data – this is even more evident in the case of deep learning problems.In order to capture non-linear relationships, we use activation functions, and that is why a neural network without an activation function is just a linear regression model. ",activ function network neural use
55,"  In a neural network, what if all the weights are initialized with the same value?","In simplest terms, if all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting.Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting.Note: This question might further lead to questions on exploding and vanishing gradients, which I have covered below. ",initi network neural valu weight

57,  What is the role of weights and bias in a neural network?,"This is a question best explained with a real-life example. Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends. Now, a number of factors can affect your decision-making, like:And so on. These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much. For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all. Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well. The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor.Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight.However, does this mean that we can play a cricket match with only one bat? No – we would need 1 ball and 6 wickets as well. This is where bias comes into the picture. Bias lets you assign some threshold which helps you activate a decision-point (or a neuron) only when that threshold is crossed. ",bia network neural role weight
58,  How does forward propagation and backpropagation work in deep learning?,"Now, this can be answered in two ways. If you are on a phone interview, you cannot perform all the calculus in writing and show the interviewer. In such cases, it best to explain it as such:For an in-person interview, it is best to take up the marker, create a simple neural network with 2 inputs, a hidden layer, and an output layer, and explain it.Forward propagation:Backpropagation:At layer L2, for all weights:At layer L1, for all weights:You need not explain with respect to the bias term as well, though you might need to expand the above equations substituting the actual derivatives. ",backpropag deep forward learn propag work
59,  What are the common data structures used in Deep Learning?,"Deep Learning goes right from the simplest data structures like lists to complicated ones like computation graphs.Here are the most common ones: Once the basics are out of the way, the interview would lead to slightly advanced deep learning concepts. These questions are much easier to answer if you have considerable practice with not only the mathematical concepts but also with coding them.Additionally, these questions can also become more project-specific. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to include examples of how you have used the concept asked in the question in your own projects. This has two advantages:Here, I have given an overview of the key concepts in the questions – you can always customize your answers to add more about your experiences with some of these deep learning algorithms and techniques. ",common data deep learn structur
60,  Why should we use Batch Normalization?,"Once the interviewer has asked you about the fundamentals of deep learning architectures, they would move on to the key topic of improving your deep learning model’s performance.Batch Normalization is one of the techniques used for reducing the training time of our deep learning algorithm. Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logistic regression model, we can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well:We basically normalize a[1] and a[2] here. This means we normalize the inputs to the layer, and then apply the activation functions to the normalized inputs.Here is an article that explains Batch Normalization and other techniques for improving Neural Networks: Neural Networks – Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization & Optimization. ",batch normal use

62,  Why does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work better with image data?,"The key to this question lies in the Convolution operation. Unlike humans, the machine sees the image as a matrix of pixel values. Instead of interpreting a shape like a petal or an ear, it just identifies curves and edges.Thus, instead of looking at the entire image, it helps to just read the image in parts. Doing this for a 300 x 300 pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one. This is convolution.Mathematically, we just perform a small operation on the matrix to help us detect features in the image – like boundaries, colors, etc.Z = X * fHere, we are convolving (* operation – not multiplication) the input matrix X with another small matrix f, called the kernel/filter to create a new matrix Z. This matrix is then passed on to the other layers.If you have a board/screen in front of you, you can always illustrate this with a simple example:Learning more about how CNNs work here. ",better cnn convolut data network neural work
63,  Why do RNNs work better with text data?,"The main component that differentiates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) from the other models is the addition of a loop at each node. This loop brings the recurrence mechanism in RNNs. In a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN), each input is given the same weight and fed to the network at the same time. So, for a sentence like “I saw the movie and hated it”, it would be difficult to capture the information which associates “it” with the “movie”.The addition of a loop is to denote preserving the previous node’s information for the next node, and so on. This is why RNNs are much better for sequential data, and since text data also is sequential in nature, they are an improvement over ANNs.",better data rnn text work
64,"  In a CNN, if the input size 5 X 5 and the filter size is 7 X 7, then what would be the size of the output?","This is a pretty intuitive answer. As we saw above, we perform the convolution on ‘x’ one step at a time, to the right, and in the end, we got Z with dimensions 2 X 2, for X with dimensions 3 X 3.Thus, to make the input size similar to the filter size, we make use of padding – adding 0s to the input matrix such that its new size becomes at least 7 X 7. Thus, the output size would be using the formula:Dimension of image = (n, n) = 5 X 5Dimension of filter = (f,f)  = 7 X 7Padding = 1 (adding 1 pixel with value 0 all around the edges)Dimension of output will be (n+2p-f+1) X (n+2p-f+1) = 1 X 1 ",5 5 7 7 cnn filter input output size size size would x x
65,  What’s the difference between valid and same padding in a CNN?,"This question has more chances of being a follow-up question to the previous one. Or if you have explained how you used CNNs in a computer vision task, the interviewer might ask this question along with the details of the padding parameters. ",cnn pad valid
66,  What do you mean by exploding and vanishing gradients?,"The key here is to make the explanation as simple as possible. As we know, the gradient descent algorithm tries to minimize the error by taking small steps towards the minimum value. These steps are used to update the weights and biases in a neural network.However, at times, the steps become too large and this results in larger updates to weights and bias terms – so much so as to cause an overflow (or a NaN) value in the weights. This leads to an unstable algorithm and is called an exploding gradient.On the other hand, the steps are too small and this leads to minimal changes in the weights and bias terms – even negligible changes at times. We thus might end up training a deep learning model with almost the same weights and biases each time and never reach the minimum error function. This is called the vanishing gradient.A point to note is that both these issues are specifically evident in Recurrent Neural Networks – so be prepared for follow-up questions on RNN! ",explod gradient mean vanish
67,  What are the applications of transfer learning in Deep Learning?,"I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level. The reason is the sheer volume of subsequent questions it can generate!The use of transfer learning has been one of the key milestones in deep learning. Training a large model on a huge dataset, and then using the final parameters on smaller simpler datasets has led to defining breakthroughs in the form of Pretrained Models. Be it Computer Vision or NLP, pretrained models have become the norm in research and in the industry.Some popular examples include BERT, ResNet, GPT-2, VGG-16, etc and many more.It is here that you can earn brownie points by pointing out specific examples/projects where you used these models and how you used them as well.It is not possible to discuss all of them, so here are a few resources to get started: It is here that questions become really specific to your projects or to what you have discussed in the interview before.Also, depending on the domain – with Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, these questions can change. While it is not important to know the architecture of each model in detail, you would need to know the intuition behind them and why these models were needed in the first place.Again, just like the intermediate level, it is important to always bring in examples that you have studied or implemented yourself into the discussion. ",applic deep learn learn transfer
68,  How backpropagation is different in RNN compared to ANN?,"In Recurrent Neural Networks, we have an additional loop at each node:This loop essentially includes a time component into the network as well. This helps in capturing sequential information from the data, which could not be possible in a generic artificial neural network.This is why the backpropagation in RNN is called Backpropagation through Time, as in backpropagation at each time step.You can find a detailed explanation of RNNs here: Fundamentals of Deep Learning – Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks. ",ann backpropag compar differ rnn
69,  How does LSTM solve the vanishing gradient challenge?,"The LSTM model is considered a special case of RNNs. The problems of vanishing gradients and exploding gradients we saw earlier are a disadvantage while using the plain RNN model.In LSTMs, we add a forget gate, which is basically a memory unit that retains information that is retained across timesteps and discards the other information that is not needed. This also necessitates the need for input and output gates to include the results of the forget gate as well. ",challeng gradient lstm solv vanish
70,  Why is GRU faster as compared to LSTM?,"As you can see, the LSTM model can become quite complex. In order to still retain the functionality of retaining information across time and yet not make a too complex model, we need GRUs.Basically, in GRUs, instead of having an additional Forget gate, we combine the input and Forget gates into a single Update Gate:It is this reduction in the number of gates that makes GRU less complex and faster than LSTM.

However, sequential processing comes with its caveats:This gave rise to the Transformer architecture. Transformers use what is called the attention mechanism.

As a result, the neurons in the earlier layer learn very slowly if we compare it with the neurons in the later layers.Earlier layers are more valuable because they are responsible for learning and detecting simple patterns. They are the building blocks of the network. If they provide improper or inaccurate results, then how can we expect the next layers and complete network to perform nicely and provide accurate results.

123,  What is a Neural Network?,"Neural Networks replicate the way humans learn, inspired by how the neurons in our brains fire, only much simpler.The most common Neural Networks consist of three network layers:Each sheet contains neurons called “nodes,” performing various operations. Neural Networks are used in deep learning algorithms like CNN, RNN, GAN, etc.Post Graduate Program in AI and Machine LearningIn Partnership with Purdue UniversityExplore Course",network neural
124,  What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)?,"As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes.Except for the input layer, each node in the other layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).",layer mlp multi perceptron
125,"  What Is Data Normalization, and Why Do We Need It?","The process of standardizing and reforming data is called “Data Normalization.” It’s a pre-processing step to eliminate data redundancy. Often, data comes in, and you get the same information in different formats. In these cases, you should rescale values to fit into a particular range, achieving better convergence.",data need normal
126,  What is the Boltzmann Machine?,"One of the most basic Deep Learning models is a Boltzmann Machine, resembling a simplified version of the Multi-Layer Perceptron. This model features a visible input layer and a hidden layer -- just a two-layer neural net that makes stochastic decisions as to whether a neuron should be on or off. Nodes are connected across layers, but no two nodes of the same layer are connected.",boltzmann machin
127,  What Is the Role of Activation Functions in a Neural Network?,"At the most basic level, an activation function decides whether a neuron should be fired or not. It accepts the weighted sum of the inputs and bias as input to any activation function. Step function, Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, and Softmax are examples of activation functions.",activ function network neural role
128,  What Is the Cost Function?,"Also referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your model’s performance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error backward through the neural network and use that during the different training functions.",cost function
129,  What Is Gradient Descent?,Gradient Descent is an optimal algorithm to minimize the cost function or to minimize an error. The aim is to find the local-global minima of a function. This determines the direction the model should take to reduce the error.,descent gradient
130,  What Do You Understand by Backpropagation?,This is one of the most frequently asked deep learning interview questions. Backpropagation is a technique to improve the performance of the network. It backpropagates the error and updates the weights to reduce the error.,backpropag understand
131,  What Is the Difference Between a Feedforward Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network?,"In this deep learning interview question, the interviewee expects you to give a detailed answer.A Feedforward Neural Network signals travel in one direction from input to output. There are no feedback loops; the network considers only the current input. It cannot memorize previous inputs (e.g., CNN).Deep Learning Course (with TensorFlow & Keras)Master the Deep Learning Concepts and ModelsView CourseA Recurrent Neural Network’s signals travel in both directions, creating a looped network. It considers the current input with the previously received inputs for generating the output of a layer and can memorize past data due to its internal memory.",feedforward network network neural neural recurr

133,  What Are the Softmax and ReLU Functions?,"Softmax is an activation function that generates the output between zero and one. It divides each output, such that the total sum of the outputs is equal to one. Softmax is often used for output layers.ReLU (or Rectified Linear Unit) is the most widely used activation function. It gives an output of X if X is positive and zeros otherwise. ReLU is often used for hidden layers.",function relu softmax
134,  What Are Hyperparameters?,"This is another frequently asked deep learning interview question. With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, epochs, etc.).",hyperparamet
135,  What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set Too Low or Too High?,"When your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal updates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point.If the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behavior to the loss function due to drastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is too chaotic for the network to train).",happen high learn low rate set
136,  What Is Dropout and Batch Normalization?,Dropout is a technique of dropping out hidden and visible units of a network randomly to prevent overfitting of data (typically dropping 20 percent of the nodes). It doubles the number of iterations needed to converge the network.Batch normalization is the technique to improve the performance and stability of neural networks by normalizing the inputs in every layer so that they have mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one.,batch dropout normal
137,  What Is the Difference Between Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent?,"Batch Gradient DescentStochastic Gradient DescentThe batch gradient computes the gradient using the entire dataset.It takes time to converge because the volume of data is huge, and weights update slowly.The stochastic gradient computes the gradient using a single sample.It converges much faster than the batch gradient because it updates weight more frequently.",batch descent descent gradient gradient stochast
138,"  What is Overfitting and Underfitting, and How to Combat Them?","Overfitting occurs when the model learns the details and noise in the training data to the degree that it adversely impacts the execution of the model on new information. It is more likely to occur with nonlinear models that have more flexibility when learning a target function. An example would be if a model is looking at cars and trucks, but only recognizes trucks that have a specific box shape. It might not be able to notice a flatbed truck because there's only a particular kind of truck it saw in training. The model performs well on training data, but not in the real world.Underfitting alludes to a model that is neither well-trained on data nor can generalize to new information. This usually happens when there is less and incorrect data to train a model. Underfitting has both poor performance and accuracy.To combat overfitting and underfitting, you can resample the data to estimate the model accuracy (k-fold cross-validation) and by having a validation dataset to evaluate the model.",combat overfit underfit
139,  How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?,"There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless.Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to 0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most commonly used method.Free Deep Learning for Beginners CourseMaster the Basics of Deep LearningEnroll Now",initi network weight

143,  What Are Vanishing and Exploding Gradients?,"While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small or too large; this makes the training difficult. When the slope is too small, the problem is known as a “Vanishing Gradient.” When the slope tends to grow exponentially instead of decaying, it’s referred to as an “Exploding Gradient.” Gradient problems lead to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy.",explod gradient vanish

146,  What Are the Programming Elements in Tensorflow?,"Constants - Constants are parameters whose value does not change. To define a constant we use  tf.constant() command. For example:a = tf.constant(2.0,tf.float32)b = tf.constant(3.0)Print(a, b)Variables - Variables allow us to add new trainable parameters to graph. To define a variable, we use the tf.Variable() command and initialize them before running the graph in a session. An example:W = tf.Variable([.3].dtype=tf.float32)b = tf.Variable([-.3].dtype=tf.float32)Placeholders - these allow us to feed data to a tensorflow model from outside a model. It permits a value to be assigned later. To define a placeholder, we use the tf.placeholder() command. An example:a = tf.placeholder (tf.float32)b = a*2with tf.Session() as sess:result = sess.run(b,feed_dict={a:3.0})print resultSessions - a session is run to evaluate the nodes.

148,  Explain Generative Adversarial Network.,"Suppose there is a wine shop purchasing wine from dealers, which they resell later. But some dealers sell fake wine. In this case, the shop owner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine.The forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop owner’s check. The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine experts that some of the wine is not original. The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic.The forger’s goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner intends to tell if the wine is real or not accurately.Let us understand this example with the help of an image shown above.There is a noise vector coming into the forger who is generating fake wine.Here the forger acts as a Generator.The shop owner acts as a Discriminator.The Discriminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine. The shop owner has to figure out whether it is real or fake.So, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named:The generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images.",adversari gener network

220,  Explain why dropout in a neural network acts as a regularizer.,"Solution: There are several (related) explanations to why dropout works. It can be seen as a form of model averaging — at each step we “turn off” a part of the model and average the models we get. It also adds noise, which naturally has a regularizing effect. It also leads to more sparsity of the weights and essentially prevents co-adaptation of neurons in the network.",act dropout network neural regular

The most popular debugging techniques are – Searching the list of values: It is about searching the data matrix for values ​​that are outside the response range. These values ​​can be considered as missing, or the correct value can be estimated from other variablesFiltering questions: It is about comparing the number of responses of a filter category and another filtered category. If any anomaly is observed that cannot be solved, it will be considered as a lost value.Checking for Logical Consistencies: The answers that may be considered contradictory to each other are checked.Counting the Level of representativeness: A count is made of the number of responses obtained in each variable. If the number of unanswered questions is very high, it is possible to assume equality between the answers and the non-answers or to make an imputation of the non-answer. Imputation Technique This technique consists of replacing the missing values ​​with valid values ​​or answers by estimating them. There are three types of imputation: Random imputation Hot Deck imputation  Imputation of the mean of subclasses ",data data deal miss miss survey survey valu would
229,  How would you deal with missing random values ​​from a data set?,"Ans. There are two forms of randomly missing values:MCAR or Missing completely at random. Such errors happen when the missing values are randomly distributed across all observations. We can confirm this error by partitioning the data into two parts –After we have partitioned the data, we conduct a t-test of mean difference to check if there is any difference in the sample between the two data sets.In case the data are MCAR, we may choose a pair-wise or a list-wise deletion of missing value cases.   MAR or Missing at random.

333,  How is Data Science different from traditional application programming?,"Data Science takes a fundamentally different approach to building systems that provide value than traditional application development. In traditional programming paradigms, we used to analyze the input, figure out the expected output, and write code, which contains rules and statements needed to transform the provided input into the expected output. As we can imagine, these rules were not easy to write, especially for those data that even computers had a hard time understanding, e.g., images, videos, etc. Data Science shifts this process a little bit. In it, we need access to large volumes of data that contain the necessary inputs and their mappings to the expected outputs. Then, we use Data Science algorithms, which use mathematical analysis to generate rules to map the given inputs to outputs. This process of rule generation is called training. After training, we use some data that was set aside before the training phase to test and check the system’s accuracy. The generated rules are a kind of a black box, and we cannot understand how the inputs are being transformed into outputs. However. if the accuracy is good enough, then we can use the system (also called a model). As described above, in traditional programming, we had to write the rules to map the input to the output, but in Data Science, the rules are automatically generated or learned from the given data. This helped solve some really difficult challenges that were being faced by several companies.

The entire process of Data Science takes care of multiple steps that are involved in drawing insights out of the available data. This process includes crucial steps such as data gathering, data analysis, data manipulation, data visualization, etc. Machine Learning, on the other hand, can be thought of as a sub-field of Data Science. It also deals with data, but here, we are solely focused on learning how to convert the processed data into a functional model, which can be used to map inputs to outputs, e.g., a model that can expect an image as an input and tell us if that image contains a flower as an output.

363,"  Explain univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.","When we are dealing with data analysis, we often come across terms such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate. Let’s try and understand what these mean.  Univariate analysis: Univariate analysis involves analysing data with only one variable or, in other words, a single column or a vector of the data. This analysis allows us to understand the data and extract patterns and trends out of it. Example: Analyzing the weight of a group of people. Bivariate analysis: Bivariate analysis involves analyzing the data with exactly two variables or, in other words, the data can be put into a two-column table. This kind of analysis allows us to figure out the relationship between the variables. Example: Analyzing the data that contains temperature and altitude. Multivariate analysis: Multivariate analysis involves analyzing the data with more than two variables. The number of columns of the data can be anything more than two. This kind of analysis allows us to figure out the effects of all other variables (input variables) on a single variable (the output variable). Example: Analyzing data about house prices, which contains information about the houses, such as locality, crime rate, area, the number of floors, etc.  When we are dealing with data analysis, we often come across terms such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate.

364,  How can we handle missing data?,"To be able to handle missing data, we first need to know the percentage of data missing in a particular column so that we can choose an appropriate strategy to handle the situation. For example, if in a column the majority of the data is missing, then dropping the column is the best option, unless we have some means to make educated guesses about the missing values. However, if the amount of missing data is low, then we have several strategies to fill them up. One way would be to fill them all up with a default value or a value that has the highest frequency in that column, such as 0 or 1, etc. This may be useful if the majority of the data in that column contain these values. Another way is to fill up the missing values in the column with the mean of all the values in that column. This technique is usually preferred as the missing values have a higher chance of being closer to the mean than to the mode. Finally, if we have a huge dataset and a few rows have values missing in some columns, then the easiest and fastest way is to drop those columns.

366,  What is bias–variance trade-off in Data Science?,"When building a model using Data Science or Machine Learning, our goal is to build one that has low bias and variance. We know that bias and variance are both errors that occur due to either an overly simplistic model or an overly complicated model. Therefore, when we are building a model, the goal of getting high accuracy is only going to be accomplished if we are aware of the tradeoff between bias and variance. Bias is an error that occurs when a model is too simple to capture the patterns in a dataset. To reduce bias, we need to make our model more complex. Although making our model more complex can lead to reducing bias, if we make our model too complex, it may end up becoming too rigid, leading to high variance. So, the tradeoff between bias and variance is that if we increase the complexity, we reduce bias and increase variance, and if we reduce complexity, then we increase bias and reduce variance. Our goal is to find a point at which our model is complex enough to give low bias but not so complex to end up having high variance.

We can make use of the elbow method to pick the appropriate k value. To do this, we run the k-means algorithm on a range of values, e.g., 1 to 15. For each value of k, we compute an average score. This score is also called inertia or the inter-cluster variance. This is calculated as the sum of squares of the distances of all values in a cluster. As k starts from a low value and goes up to a high value, we start seeing a sharp decrease in the inertia value. After a certain value of k, in the range, the drop in the inertia value becomes quite small. This is the value of k that we need to choose for the k-means clustering algorithm.

They are as follows:  The data, which is a sample drawn from a population, used to train the model should be representative of the population. The relationship between independent variables and the mean of dependent variables is linear. The variance of the residual is going to be the same for any value of an independent variable. It is also represented as X. Each observation is independent of all other observations. For any value of an independent variable, the independent variable is normally distributed.  There are several assumptions required for linear regression. They are as follows:",assumpt linear regress
392,  What happens when some of the assumptions required for linear regression are violated?,"These assumptions may be violated lightly (i.e., some minor violations) or strongly (i.e., the majority of the data has violations). Both of these violations will have different effects on a linear regression model. Strong violations of these assumptions make the results entirely redundant. Light violations of these assumptions make the results have greater bias or variance. ",assumpt happen linear regress violat
393,  What do you understand by linear regression?,"Linear regression helps in understanding the linear relationship between the dependent and the independent variables. Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm, which helps in finding the linear relationship between two variables. One is the predictor or the independent variable and the other is the response or the dependent variable. In Linear Regression, we try to understand how the dependent variable changes w.r.t the independent variable. If there is only one independent variable, then it is called simple linear regression, and if there is more than one independent variable then it is known as multiple linear regression.

394,  What do you understand by logistic regression?,"Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that can be used when the dependent variable is binary. Let’s take an example. Here, we are trying to determine whether it will rain or not on the basis of temperature and humidity.  Temperature and humidity are the independent variables, and rain would be our dependent variable. So, the logistic regression algorithm actually produces an S shape curve. Now, let us look at another scenario: Let’s suppose that x-axis represents the runs scored by Virat Kohli and the y-axis represents the probability of the team India winning the match. From this graph, we can say that if Virat Kohli scores more than 50 runs, then there is a greater probability for team India to win the match. Similarly, if he scores less than 50 runs then the probability of team India winning the match is less than 50 percent.  So, basically in logistic regression, the y value lies within the range of 0 and 1. This is how logistic regression works.

419,  How many binary classifiers would you need to implement one-vs-all for three classes? How does it work?,"You would need three binary classifiers to implement one-vs-all for three classes since the number of binary classifiers is precisely equal to the number of classes with this approach. If you have three classes given by y=1, y=2, and y=3, then the three classifiers in the one-vs-all approach would consist of h(1)(x), which classifies the test cases as 1 or not 1, h(2)(x) which classifies the test cases as 2 or not 2 and so on. You can then take the results together to arrive at the correct classification. For example, with three categories, Cats, Dogs, and Rabbits, to implement the one-vs-all approach, we need to make the following comparisons:    Binary Classification Problem 1: Cats vs. Dogs, Rabbits (or not Cats)    Binary Classification Problem 2: Dogs vs. Cats, Rabbits (or not Dogs)    Binary Classification Problem 3: Rabbits vs. Cats, Dogs (or not Rabbits)Recommended Reading: ",binari class classifi implement need three v work would

421,  What is the importance of regularisation? ,"Regularisation is a technique that can help alleviate the problem of overfitting a model. It is beneficial when a large number of parameters are present, which help predict the target function. In these circumstances, it is difficult to select which features to keep manually. Regularisation essentially involves adding coefficient terms to the cost function so that the terms are penalized and are small in magnitude. This helps, in turn, to preserve the overall trends in the data while not letting the model become too complex. These penalties, in effect, restrict the influence a predictor variable can have over the target by compressing the coefficients, thereby preventing overfitting.",import regularis
422,  Why is the Wald Test useful in logistic regression but not in linear regression? ,"The Wald test, also known as the Wald Chi-Squared Test, is a method to find whether the independent variables in a model are of significance. The significance of variables is decided by whether they contribute to the predictions or not. The variables that add no value to the model can therefore be deleted without risking severe adverse effects to the model. The Wald test is unnecessary in linear regression because it is easy to compare a more complicated model to a simpler model to check the influence of the added independent variables. After all, we can use the R2 value to make this comparison. However, this is not possible with logistic regression as we use Maximum Likelihood Estimate, which uses the previously mentioned method infeasible. The Wald test can be used for many different models, including those with binary variables or continuous variables, and has the added advantage that it only requires estimating one model.",linear logist regress regress test use wald
423,  Will the decision boundary be linear or non-linear in logistic regression models? Explain with an example.,"The decision boundary is essentially a line or a plane that demarcates the boundary between the classes to which linear regression classifies the dependent variables. The shape of the decision boundary will depend entirely on the logistic regression model.For logistic regression model given by hypothesis function h(x)=g(Tx)where g is the sigmoid function, if the hypothesis function is h(x)=g(1+2x2+3x3)then the decision boundary is linear. Alternatively, if h(x)=g(1+2x22+3x32)then the decision boundary is non-linear.",boundari decis exampl linear linear logist model non regress
424,  What are odds? Why is it used in logistic regression?,"Odds are the ratio of the probability of success to the probability of failure. The odds serve to provide the constant effect a particular predictor or independent variable has on the output prediction.

If this were just another machine learning problem of not too much consequence, this would be acceptable. However, when the problems involve deciding whether to consider a candidate for life-saving treatment, false positives might not be as bad as false negatives.

The main objective behind Logistic Regression is to determine the relationship between features and the probability of a particular outcome.For Example, when we need to predict whether a student passes or fails in an exam given the number of hours spent studying as a feature, the target variable comprises two values i.e. pass and fail.Therefore, we can solve classification problem statements which is a supervised machine learning technique using Logistic Regression.",logist mean regress
432,  Explain the intuition behind Logistic Regression in detail.,"Given:By using the training dataset, we can find the dependent(x) and independent variables(y), so if we can determine the parameters w (Normal) and b (y-intercept), then we can easily find a decision boundary that can almost separate both the classes in a linear fashion.Objective: In order to train a Logistic Regression model, we just need w and b to find a line(in 2D), plane(3D), or hyperplane(in more than 3-D dimension) that can separate both the classes point as perfect as possible so that when it encounters with any new unseen data point, it can easily classify, from which class the unseen data point belongs to.For Example, Let us consider we have only two features as x1 and x2.Let’s take any of the +ve class points (figure below) and find the shortest distance from that point to the plane. Here, the shortest distance is computed using:di = wT*xi / ||w||If weight vector is a unit vector i.e, ||w||=1. Then,di = wT*xiSince w and xi are on the same side of the decision boundary therefore distance will be +ve. Now for a negative point, we have to compute dj = wT*xj. For point xj, distance will be -ve since this point is the opposite side of w.Thus we can conclude, points that are in the same direction of w are considered as +ve points and the points which are in the opposite direction of w are considered as -ve points.Now, we can easily classify the unseen data points as -ve and +ve points. If the value of wT*xi>0, then y =+1 and if value of wT*xi < 0 then y = -1.Now, by observing all the cases above now our objective is that our classifier minimizes the miss-classification error, i.e, we want the values of yi*wT*xi to be greater than 0.In our problem, xi and yi are fixed because these are coming from the dataset.As we change the values of the parameters w, and b the sum will change and we want to find that w and b that maximize the sum given below. To calculate the parameters w and b, we can use the Gradient Descent optimizer. Therefore, the optimization function for logistic regression is:",behind detail intuit logist regress

434,  What factors can attribute to the popularity of Logistic Regression?,"Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm as it converts the values of the log of odds which can range from -inf to +inf to a range between 0 and 1.Since logistic functions output the probability of occurrence of an event, they can be applied to many real-life scenarios therefore these models are very popular. ",attribut factor logist popular regress

438,  How do we handle categorical variables in Logistic Regression?,"The inputs given to a Logistic Regression model need to be numeric. The algorithm cannot handle categorical variables directly. So, we need to convert the categorical data into a numerical format that is suitable for the algorithm to process.Each level of the categorical variable will be assigned a unique numeric value also known as a dummy variable. These dummy variables are handled by the Logistic Regression model in the same manner as any other numeric value. 10. Which algorithm is better in the case of outliers present in the dataset i.e., Logistic Regression or SVM?SVM (Support Vector Machines) handles the outliers in a better manner than the Logistic Regression.Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression will identify a linear boundary if it exists to accommodate the outliers. To accommodate the outliers, it will shift the linear boundary.SVM: SVM is insensitive to individual samples. So, to accommodate an outlier there will not be a major shift in the linear boundary.

If wT*xi>0, the point is +ve, and if wT*xi < 0, the point is negative. As w is a vector of size d, performing the operation wT*xi takes O(d) steps as discussed earlier.Therefore, the testing complexity of the Logistic Regression is O(d).Hence, Logistic Regression is very good for low latency applications, i.e, for applications where the dimension of the data is small.",complex discus logist regress runtim test
443,  Why is Logistic Regression termed as Regression and not classification?,"The major difference between Regression and classification problem statements is that the target variable in the Regression is numerical (or continuous) whereas in classification it is categorical (or discrete).Logistic Regression is basically a supervised classification algorithm. However, the Logistic Regression builds a model just like linear regression in order to predict the probability that a given data point belongs to the category numbered as “1”.For Example, Let’s have a binary classification problem, and ‘x’ be some feature and ‘y’ be the target outcome which can be either 0 or 1.The probability that the target outcome is 1 given its input can be represented as:If we predict the probability by using linear Regression, we can describe it as:where, p(x) = p(y=1|x)Logistic regression models generate predicted probabilities as any number ranging from neg to pos infinity while the probability of an outcome can only lie between 0< P(x)<1.However, to solve the problem of outliers, a sigmoid function is used in Logistic Regression.

445,  Why can’t we use Mean Square Error (MSE) as a cost function for Logistic Regression?,"In Logistic Regression, we use the sigmoid function to perform a non-linear transformation to obtain the probabilities. If we square this nonlinear transformation, then it will lead to the problem of non-convexity with local minimums and by using gradient descent in such cases, it is not possible to find the global minimum. As a result, MSE is not suitable for Logistic Regression.So, in the Logistic Regression algorithm, we used Cross-entropy or log loss as a cost function. The property of the cost function for Logistic Regression is that:By optimizing this cost function, convergence is achieved.",cost error function logist mean mse regress squar use
446,  Can you explain cost function of decision trees?,"Answer: Before we answer this question, it is important to note that Decision Trees are versatile Machine Learning algorithms that can perform both classification and regression tasks. Hence their cost functions are also different.Cost function for classification type problems:Gini impurity is an important concept before we can understand cost function, so let me first explain that.where “p” is the ratio of class k instances among the training instances at the ith node. What does that mean? Let’s understand from an example below. Figure I displays a simple visualization of Iris Decision Tree of depth 2. Top level is the root node. The concept of dividing a training set into a set of decisions is fairly simple in the algorithm. Here, for instance, Iris data set is divided into two subsets based on a single feature called “petal width” at the root node. If petal width is less than or equal to 0.8, then the algorithm goes to depth 1, left. If not, it goes to depth 1, right. Where it further divides instances based on an additional feature of “petal width”. Depth 1, right node has a sample of 100 instances and applies 0 instances to Iris-Setosa, 50 instances to Iris-Versicolor and remaining 50 to Iris-Virginica.So this node’s gini impurity is 0.5:Similarly, at depth 1, left node, Gini impurity is zero because all training instances apply to the same class. The node is essentially “pure”.Now that understand what is Gini impurity, let’s get into the meat of the answer. Decision Trees use Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm for training purposes based on a simple concept that the data set will be split into two subsets using a single feature (k) and threshold (t) . In Iris data set the feature was “petal width” and threshold was 0.8. How does it choose k and t? It searches for the pair (k, t) that produces the purest subsets. So the cost function that the algorithm tries to minimize is given by below equation:where G left or right represent gini impurity of subsets while m represents instances of the subsets.Cost function for regression type problems:For regression trees, cost function is fairly intuitive. We use Residual Sum of Squares (RSS). Equation III displays cost function of regression type trees, where “y” is ground truth and “y-hat” is the predicted value.",cost decis function tree
447,  How does collinearity affect your models?,"Answer: Collinearity refers to a situation where two or more predictor variables are closely related to one another. Figure 2 below shows as example of collinear variables. Variable 2 strictly follows variable 1 with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 1. So obviously one of these variables will behave like noise when fed into machine learning models.The presence of collinearity can become problematic in regression type questions, since it becomes difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear variables on the response. Or in other words collinearity reduces the accuracy of the estimates of the regression coefficients and results in increase in errors. This will ultimately lead to decline in the t-statistic, as a result, in the presence of collinearity we may fail to reject the null hypothesis.A simple way to detect collinearity is to look at the correlation matrix of the predictor variables. An element of this matrix that is large in absolute value indicates a pair of highly correlated variables, and therefore collinearity problem with the data. Unfortunately not all collinearity problems can be detected by inspection of the correlation matrix: it is possible for the collinearity to exist between three or more variables even if no pair of variables has a particularly high correlation. Such a situation is called multi-collinearity. For such cases, instead of inspecting the correlation matrix, a better way to assess multicollinearity is to compute the variance inflation factor (VIF). The VIF for each variable can be computed using the formula:Where R-square term is the regression of variable X, onto all of the other predictors. If VIF is close to or more than one then collinearity is present. When faced with the problem of collinearity there are two possible solutions. One is to drop the redundant variable. This can be done without compromising the regression fit. The second solution is to combine the collinear variables together into a single predictor.",affect collinear model
448,  How will you explain deep neural network to a layman?,"Answer: The idea of Neural Network (NN) originally stemmed from human brain that is designed to identify patterns. NN is a set of algorithms that interpret sensory data through machine perception, labeling and clustering raw input data. Any type of real world data, be it images, text, sound or even time series data must be converted into a vector space containing numbers.The word “deep” in deep neural network means that the neural network consists of multiple layers. These layers are made of nodes where computation takes place. An analogy of node is a neuron in human brain which fires when it encounters sufficient stimuli. A node combines data from the raw input with their coefficients or weights that either dampen or amplify that input based on the weight. The product of input and weight is then summed at the summation node shown below in Fig. 3, which is then passed on to the activation function which determines whether and to what extend that signal should progress further through the network to affect the ultimate outcome. A node layer is a row of such neuron-like switches that turn on or off as the input is fed through the network.Deep neural networks differs from earlier version of neural networks such as perceptrons because they were shallow and simply consisted of input and output layer along with one hidden layer.",deep layman network neural

450,  What do you mean by model regularization and how will you achieve regularization in linear models?,"Answer: Regularization is a term used for constraining your machine learning model. One good way to constrain or reduce overfitting in machine learning models is to have fewer degrees of freedom. With fewer degrees of freedom, it gets harder for the model to overfit the data. For example, a simple way to regularize a polynomial model is to reduce the number of polynomial degrees of freedom. However, for linear models, regularization is typically achieved by constraining the weights of the model. So, instead of linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net models have three different ways to constraint the weights. For the sake of completeness, lets start with the definition of linear regression first:Mean Square Error cost function for a Linear Regression model is defined as:Where thetaT is the transpose of theta (a row vector instead of column vector).Ridge Regression: Is a regularized version of Linear Regression, i.e., an additional regularization term is added to the cost function. This forces the learning algorithms to not only fit the data but also keep the model weights as small as possible. Note that the regularization term should only be added to the cost function during training. Once the model is trained, you want to evaluate the model’s performance using the unregularized performance measure.The hyperparameter alpha controls how much you want to regularize the model. If alpha is zero, then ridge regression is just linear regression.Lasso Regression: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression (simple called Lasso Regression) is another regularized version of Linear Regression: Just like the Ridge Regression, it adds a regularization term to the cost function, but it uses the L1 norm of the weight vector instead of half the square of the L2 norm .An important characteristic of Lasso Regression is that it tends to completely eliminate the weights of the least important features (i.e., set them to zero). In other words, Lasso Regression automatically performs feature selection and outputs a sparse model (i.e., with a few non-zero feature weights).Elastic Net Regression: This is a middle ground between Ridge and Lasso regression. The regularization term is a simple mix of both Ridge and Lasso’s regularization term and can be controlled with “r”. When r=0, Elastic Net is equivalent to Ridge Regression, and when r=1, it is equivalent to Lasso Regression.It is always preferable to have at least a little bit of regularization and generally plain linear regression should always be avoided. Ridge is a good default, but if only a few features are useful in a particular data set, then Lasso should be used. In general, Elastic Net is preferred over Lasso since Lasso may behave erratically when the number of features is greater than the number of instances or when several features are strongly correlated.",achiev linear mean model regular regular

So if the dataset is large, there will be a lot of processing which may adversely impact the performance of the algorithm.Sensitive to noise:Another thing in the context of large datasets is that there is more likely a chance of noise in the dataset which adversely affects the performance of the KNN algorithm since the KNN algorithm is sensitive to the noise present in the dataset.",dataset knn larg recommend use

469,  How to choose the optimal value of K in the KNN Algorithm?,"There is no straightforward method to find the optimal value of K in the KNN algorithm.You have to play around with different values to choose which value of K should be optimal for my problem statement. Choosing the right value of K is done through a process known as Hyperparameter Tuning.The optimum value of K for KNN is highly dependent on the data itself. In different scenarios, the optimum K may vary. It is more or less a hit and trial method.There is no one proper method of finding the K value in the KNN algorithm. No method is the rule of thumb but you should try the following suggestions:1. Square Root Method: Take the square root of the number of samples in the training dataset and assign it to the K value.2. Cross-Validation Method: We should also take the help of cross-validation to find out the optimal value of K in KNN. Start with the minimum value of k i.e, K=1, and run cross-validation, measure the accuracy, and keep repeating till the results become consistent.As the value of K increases, the error usually goes down after each one-step increase in K, then stabilizes, and then raises again. Finally, pick the optimum K at the beginning of the stable zone. This technique is also known as the Elbow Method. Image Source: Google Images3.

470,  How can you relate KNN Algorithm to the Bias-Variance tradeoff?,"Problem with having too small K:The major concern associated with small values of K lies behind the fact that the smaller value causes noise to have a higher influence on the result which will also lead to a large variance in the predictions.Problem with having too large K:The larger the value of K, the higher is the accuracy. If K is too large, then our model is under-fitted. As a result, the error will go up again. So, to prevent your model from under-fitting it should retain the generalization capabilities otherwise there are fair chances that your model may perform well in the training data but drastically fail in the real data. The computational expense of the algorithm also increases if we choose the k very large.So, choosing k to a large value may lead to a model with a large bias(error).The effects of k values on the bias and variance is explained below :So, there is a tradeoff between overfitting and underfitting and you have to maintain a balance while choosing the value of K in KNN.

471,  Which algorithm can be used for value imputation in both categorical and continuous categories of data?,"KNN is the only algorithm that can be used for the imputation of both categorical and continuous variables. It can be used as one of many techniques when it comes to handling missing values.To impute a new sample, we determine the samples in the training set “nearest” to the new sample and averages the nearby points to impute. A Scikit learn library of Python provides a quick and convenient way to use this technique.Note: NaNs are omitted while distances are calculated. Hence we replace the missing values with the average value of the neighbours. The missing values will then be replaced by the average value of their “neighbours”. 15. Explain the statement- “The KNN algorithm does more computation on test time rather than train time”.The above-given statement is absolutely true.The basic idea behind the kNN algorithm is to determine a k-long list of samples that are close to a sample that we want to classify. Therefore, the training phase is basically storing a training set, whereas during the prediction stage the algorithm looks for k-neighbours using that stored data.

473,  What are the advantages of the KNN Algorithm?,"Some of the advantages of the KNN algorithm are as follows:1. No Training Period: It does not learn anything during the training period since it does not find any discriminative function with the help of the training data. In simple words, actually, there is no training period for the KNN algorithm. It stores the training dataset and learns from it only when we use the algorithm for making the real-time predictions on the test dataset.As a result, the KNN algorithm is much faster than other algorithms which require training. For Example, SupportVector Machines(SVMs), Linear Regression, etc.Moreover, since the KNN algorithm does not require any training before making predictions as a result new data can be added seamlessly without impacting the accuracy of the algorithm.2.

Does not work well with high dimensions: KNN algorithms generally do not work well with high dimensional data since, with the increasing number of dimensions, it becomes difficult to calculate the distance for each dimension.3. Need feature scaling: We need to do feature scaling (standardization and normalization) on the dataset before feeding it to the KNN algorithm otherwise it may generate wrong predictions.4.

Moreover, the very nature of a credit rating where people who have similar financial details would be given similar credit ratings also plays an important role. Hence the existing database can then be used to predict a new customer’s credit rating, without having to perform all the calculations.2.

477,  What are Support Vector Machines (SVMs)?,"👉 SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that works on both classification and regression problem statements.👉 For classification problem statements, it tries to differentiate data points of different classes by finding a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes in the training data.👉 In simple words, SVM tries to choose the hyperplane which separates the data points as widely as possible since this margin maximization improves the model’s accuracy on the test or the unseen data.Image Source: link",machin support svm vector
478,  What are Support Vectors in SVMs?,"👉 Support vectors are those instances that are located on the margin itself. For SVMS, the decision boundary is entirely determined by using only the support vectors.👉 Any instance that is not a support vector (not on the margin boundaries) has no influence whatsoever; you could remove them or add more instances, or move them around, and as long as they stay off the margin they won’t affect the decision boundary.👉 For computing the predictions, only the support vectors are involved, not the whole training set.",support svm vector
479,  What is the basic principle of a Support Vector Machine?,"It’s aimed at finding an optimal hyperplane that is linearly separable, and for the dataset which is not directly linearly separable, it extends its formulation by transforming the original data to map into a new space, which is also called kernel trick.",machin principl support vector

482,  What is the “Kernel trick”?,👉 A Kernel is a function capable of computing the dot product of instances mapped in higher dimension space without actually transforming all the instances into the higher feature space and calculating the dot product.👉 This trick makes the whole process much less computationally expensive than that actual transformation to calculate the dot product and this is the essence of the kernel trick.Image Source: link,kernel trick
483,  What is the role of the C hyper-parameter in SVM? Does it affect the bias/variance trade-off?,"👉 The balance between keeping the margins as large as possible and limiting the margin violation is controlled by the C parameter: a small value leads to a wider street but more margin violation and a higher value of C makes fewer margin violations but ends up with a smaller margin and overfitting.👉 Here thing becomes a little complex as we have conflicting objectives of making the slack variables as small as possible to reduce margin violation and make W as small as possible to increase the margin. This is where the role of the C hyperparameter comes in which allows us to define the trade-off between these two objectives.8. Explain different types of kernel functions.A function is called kernel if there exist a function ϕ that maps a and b into another space such that K(a, b) = ϕ(a)T · ϕ(b). So you can use K as a kernel since you just know that a mapping ϕ exists, even if you don’t know what ϕ function is. These are the very good things about kernels.Some of the kernel functions are as follows:👉 Polynomial Kernel: These are the kernel functions that represent the similarity of vectors in a feature space over polynomials of original variables.👉 Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel:  Gaussian RBF kernel maps each training instance to an infinite-dimensional space, therefore it’s a good thing that you don’t need to perform the mapping.Image Source: link",affect bia c hyper paramet role svm trade varianc

So we can see that if the points are linearly separable then only our hyperplane is able to distinguish between them and if any outlier is introduced then it is not able to separate them. So these type of SVM is called hard margin SVM (since we have very strict constraints to correctly classify each and every data point).To overcome this, we introduce a term ( ξ ) (pronounced as Zeta)if ξi= 0, the points can be considered as correctly classified.if ξi> 0 , Incorrectly classified points.",hard know margin margin soft svm svm
495,  What is Hinge Loss?,"Explanation: Hinge Loss is a loss function which penalises the SVM model for inaccurate predictions.If Yi(WT*Xi +b) ≥ 1, hinge loss is ‘0’ i.e the points are correctly classified. WhenYi(WT*Xi +b) < 1, then hinge loss increases massively.As Yi(WT*Xi +b) increases with every misclassified point, the upper bound of hinge loss {1- Yi(WT*Xi +b)} also increases exponentially.Hence, the points that are farther away from the decision margins have a greater loss value, thus penalising those points.We can formulate hinge loss as max[0, 1- Yi(WT*Xi +b)]",hing loss
496,  Explain the Dual form of SVM formulation?,"Explanation: The aim of the Soft Margin formulation is to minimizesubject toThis is also known as the primal form of SVM.The duality theory provides a convenient way to deal with the constraints. The dual optimization problem can be written in terms of dot products, thereby making it possible to use kernel functions.It is possible to express a different but closely related problem, called its dual problem. The solution to the dual problem typically gives a lower bound to the solution of the primal problem, but under some conditions, it can even have the same solutions as the primal problem. Luckily, the SVM problem happens to meet these conditions, so you can choose to solve the primal problem or the dual problem; both will have the same solution.",dual form formul svm
497,  What’s the “kernel trick” and how is it useful?,"Explanation: Earlier we have discussed applying SVM on linearly separable data but it is very rare to get such data.

The computational complexity of the primal form of the SVM problem is proportional to the number of training instances m, while the computational complexity of the dual form is proportional to a number between m² and m³.

The performance depends on many factorsthe number of training instancesthe distribution of the datalinear vs. non-linear problemsinput scale of the featuresthe chosen hyperparametershow you validate/evaluate your modelIn general, It is easier to train a well-performing Random Forest classifier since you have to worry less about hyperparameter optimization. Due to the nature Random Forests, you are less likely to overfit. You simply grow ntrees on n bootstrap samples of the training set on feature subspaces — using the majority vote, the estimate will be pretty robust.Using Support Vector Machines, you have “more things” to “worry” about such as choosing an appropriate kernel (poly, RBF, linear …), the regularization penalty, the regularization strength, kernel parameters such as the poly degree or gamma, and so forth.So, in sum, We can say that Random Forests are much more automated and thus “easier” to train compared to SVMs, but there are many examples in literature where SVMs outperform Random Forests and vice versa on different datasets. So, if you like to compare these two, make sure that you run a large enough grid search for the SVM and use nested cross-validation to reduce the performance estimation bias.

517,  What is the role of C in SVM?,"What is the role of C in SVM?Ans. The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example. For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly. Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points. For very tiny values of C, you should get misclassified examples, often even if your training data is linearly separable.",c role svm
518,  What is the intuition of a large margin classifier?,"What is the intuition of a large margin classifier?Ans. Let’s say you’ve found a hyperplane that completely separates the two classes in your training set. We expect that when new data comes along (i.e. your test set), the new data will look like your training data. Points that should be classified as one class or the other should lie near the points in your training data with the corresponding class. Now, if your hyperplane is oriented such that it is close to some of the points in your training set, there’s a good chance that the new data will lie on the wrong side of the hyperplane, even if the new points lie close to training examples of the correct class.So we say that we want to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin. That is, find a hyperplane that divides your data properly, but is also as far as possible from your data points. That way, when new data comes in, even if it is a little closer to the wrong class than the training points, it will still lie on the right side of the hyperplane.If your data is separable, then there are infinitely many hyperplanes that will separate it. SVM (and some other classifiers) optimizes for the one with the maximum margin, as described above.",classifi intuit larg margin
519,  What is a kernel in SVM? Why do we use kernels in SVM?,"What is a kernel in SVM? Why do we use kernels in SVM?Ans. SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions that are defined as the kernel. The function of kernel is to take data as input and transform it into the required form. Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions. These functions can be different types. For example linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. Introduce Kernel functions for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors. The most used type of kernel function is RBF.

522,  What is the difference between logistic regression and SVM,"What is the difference between logistic regression and SVMAns. Logistic regression assumes that the predictors aren’t sufficient to determine the response variable, but determine a probability that is a logistic function of a linear combination of them. If there’s a lot of noise, logistic regression (usually fit with maximum-likelihood techniques) is a great technique.On the other hand, there are problems where you have thousands of dimensions and the predictors do nearly-certainly determine the response, but in some hard-to-explicitly-program way. An example would be image recognition. If you have a grayscale image, 100 by 100 pixels, you have 10,000 dimensions already. With various basis transforms (kernel trick) you will be able to get a linear separator of the data.Non-regularized logistic regression techniques don’t work well (in fact, the fitted coefficients diverge) when there’s a separating hyperplane, because the maximum likelihood is achieved by any separating plane, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll get the best one. What you get is an extremely confident model with poor predictive power near the margin.SVMs get you the best separating hyperplane, and they’re efficient in high dimensional spaces. They’re similar to regularization in terms of trying to find the lowest-normed vector that separates the data, but with a margin condition that favors choosing a good hyperplane. A hard-margin SVM will find a hyperplane that separates all the data (if one exists) and fail if there is none; soft-margin SVMs (generally preferred) do better when there’s noise in the data.Additionally, SVMs only consider points near the margin (support vectors). Logistic regression considers all the points in the data set. Which you prefer depends on your problem.Logistic regression is great in a low number of dimensions and when the predictors don’t suffice to give more than a probabilistic estimate of the response. SVMs do better when there’s a higher number of dimensions, and especially on problems where the predictors do certainly (or near-certainly) determine the responses.",logist regress svm

XGBoost can be used to train a standalone random forest. Also, random forest can be used as a base model for gradient boosting techniques.Solution:Further, random forest is an improvement over bagging that helps in reducing the variance. Random forest builds trees in parallel, while in boosting, trees are built sequentially.

In case of (10, female), the test “age < 15” is to be performed first and then proceed to the left branch, because “age < 15” is true.

540,  Is it possible to apply Linear Regression for Time Series Analysis?,"Yes, we can apply a linear regression algorithm for doing analysis on time series data, but the results are not promising and hence is not advisable to do so.The reasons behind not preferable linear regression on time-series data are as follows: Time series data is mostly used for the prediction of the future but in contrast, linear regression generally seldom gives good results for future prediction as it is basically not meant for extrapolation. Moreover, time-series data have a pattern, such as during peak hours, festive seasons, etc., which would most likely be treated as outliers in the linear regression analysis.

541,  How can learning curves help create a better model?,"Learning curves give the indication of the presence of overfitting or underfitting.  In a learning curve, the training error and cross-validating error are plotted against the number of training data points. A typical learning curve looks like this:  If the training error and true error (cross-validating error) converge to the same value and the corresponding value of the error is high, it indicates that the model is underfitting and is suffering from high bias.  If there is a significant gap between the converging values of the training and cross-validating errors, i.e. the cross-validating error is significantly higher than the training error, it suggests that the model is overfitting the training data and is suffering from a high variance.

542,  What is the difference between a Perceptron and Logistic Regression?,"A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is one of the most basic neural networks that we use for classification. For a binary classification problem, we know that the output can be either 0 or 1. This is just like our simple logistic regression, where we use a logit function to generate a probability between 0 and 1.So, what’s the difference between the two?Simply put, it is just the difference in the threshold function! When we restrict the logistic regression model to give us either exactly 1 or exactly 0, we get a Perceptron model:",logist perceptron regress
543,  Can we have the same bias for all neurons of a hidden layer?,"Essentially, you can have a different bias value at each layer or at each neuron as well. However, it is best if we have a bias matrix for all the neurons in the hidden layers as well.A point to note is that both these strategies would give you very different results.",bia hidden layer neuron
544,"  What if we do not use any activation function(s) in a neural network?
","The main aim of this question is to understand why we need activation functions in a neural network. You can start off by giving a simple explanation of how neural networks are built:Step 1: Calculate the sum of all the inputs (X) according to their weights and include the bias term:Z = (weights * X) + biasStep 2: Apply an activation function to calculate the expected output:Y = Activation(Z)Steps 1 and 2 are performed at each layer. If you recollect, this is nothing but forward propagation! Now, what if there is no activation function?Our equation for Y essentially becomes:Y = Z = (weights * X) + biasWait – isn’t this just a simple linear equation? Yes – and that is why we need activation functions. A linear equation will not be able to capture the complex patterns in the data – this is even more evident in the case of deep learning problems.In order to capture non-linear relationships, we use activation functions, and that is why a neural network without an activation function is just a linear regression model.",activ function network neural use
545,"  In a neural network, what if all the weights are initialized with the same value?","In simplest terms, if all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.In short, there is no learning happening by the network! What do you call the phenomenon of the model being unable to learn any patterns from the data? Yes, underfitting.Therefore, if all weights have the same initial value, this would lead to underfitting.Note: This question might further lead to questions on exploding and vanishing gradients, which I have covered below.",initi network neural valu weight
546,  List the supervised and unsupervised tasks in Deep Learning.,"Now, this can be one tricky question.

Some example of Supervised Learning and Deep learning include:On the other hand, there are some unsupervised deep learning techniques as well:Here is a great article on applications of Deep Learning for unsupervised tasks:",deep learn list supervis task unsupervis
547,  What is the role of weights and bias in a neural network?,"This is a question best explained with a real-life example. Consider that you want to go out today to play a cricket match with your friends. Now, a number of factors can affect your decision-making, like:And so on. These factors can change your decision greatly or not too much. For example, if it is raining outside, then you cannot go out to play at all. Or if you have only one bat, you can share it while playing as well. The magnitude by which these factors can affect the game is called the weight of that factor.Factors like the weather or temperature might have a higher weight, and other factors like equipment would have a lower weight.However, does this mean that we can play a cricket match with only one bat? No – we would need 1 ball and 6 wickets as well. This is where bias comes into the picture. Bias lets you assign some threshold which helps you activate a decision-point (or a neuron) only when that threshold is crossed.",bia network neural role weight
548,  How does forward propagation and backpropagation work in deep learning?,"Now, this can be answered in two ways. If you are on a phone interview, you cannot perform all the calculus in writing and show the interviewer. In such cases, it best to explain it as such:For an in-person interview, it is best to take up the marker, create a simple neural network with 2 inputs, a hidden layer, and an output layer, and explain it.Forward propagation:Backpropagation:At layer L2, for all weights:At layer L1, for all weights:You need not explain with respect to the bias term as well, though you might need to expand the above equations substituting the actual derivatives.",backpropag deep forward learn propag work
549,  What are the common data structures used in Deep Learning?,"Deep Learning goes right from the simplest data structures like lists to complicated ones like computation graphs.Here are the most common ones:Once the basics are out of the way, the interview would lead to slightly advanced deep learning concepts. These questions are much easier to answer if you have considerable practice with not only the mathematical concepts but also with coding them.Additionally, these questions can also become more project-specific. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to include examples of how you have used the concept asked in the question in your own projects. This has two advantages:Here, I have given an overview of the key concepts in the questions – you can always customize your answers to add more about your experiences with some of these deep learning algorithms and techniques.",common data deep learn structur
550,  Why should we use Batch Normalization?,"Once the interviewer has asked you about the fundamentals of deep learning architectures, they would move on to the key topic of improving your deep learning model’s performance.Batch Normalization is one of the techniques used for reducing the training time of our deep learning algorithm. Just like normalizing our input helps improve our logistic regression model, we can normalize the activations of the hidden layers in our deep learning model as well:We basically normalize a[1] and a[2] here. This means we normalize the inputs to the layer, and then apply the activation functions to the normalized inputs.Here is an article that explains Batch Normalization and other techniques for improving Neural Networks: Neural Networks – Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization & Optimization.",batch normal use
551,  Why does a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) work better with image data?,"The key to this question lies in the Convolution operation. Unlike humans, the machine sees the image as a matrix of pixel values. Instead of interpreting a shape like a petal or an ear, it just identifies curves and edges.Thus, instead of looking at the entire image, it helps to just read the image in parts. Doing this for a 300 x 300 pixel image would mean dividing the matrix into smaller 3 x 3 matrices and dealing with them one by one. This is convolution.Mathematically, we just perform a small operation on the matrix to help us detect features in the image – like boundaries, colors, etc.Z = X * fHere, we are convolving (* operation – not multiplication) the input matrix X with another small matrix f, called the kernel/filter to create a new matrix Z. This matrix is then passed on to the other layers.If you have a board/screen in front of you, you can always illustrate this with a simple example:Learning more about how CNNs work here.",better cnn convolut data network neural work
552,"  In a CNN, if the input size 5 X 5 and the filter size is 7 X 7, then what would be the size of the output?","This is a pretty intuitive answer. As we saw above, we perform the convolution on ‘x’ one step at a time, to the right, and in the end, we got Z with dimensions 2 X 2, for X with dimensions 3 X 3.Thus, to make the input size similar to the filter size, we make use of padding – adding 0s to the input matrix such that its new size becomes at least 7 X 7. Thus, the output size would be using the formula:Dimension of image = (n, n) = 5 X 5Dimension of filter = (f,f)  = 7 X 7Padding = 1 (adding 1 pixel with value 0 all around the edges)Dimension of output will be (n+2p-f+1) X (n+2p-f+1) = 1 X 1",5 5 7 7 cnn filter input output size size size would x x
553,  What’s the difference between valid and same padding in a CNN?,"This question has more chances of being a follow-up question to the previous one. Or if you have explained how you used CNNs in a computer vision task, the interviewer might ask this question along with the details of the padding parameters.",cnn pad valid
554,  What do you mean by exploding and vanishing gradients?,"The key here is to make the explanation as simple as possible. As we know, the gradient descent algorithm tries to minimize the error by taking small steps towards the minimum value. These steps are used to update the weights and biases in a neural network.However, at times, the steps become too large and this results in larger updates to weights and bias terms – so much so as to cause an overflow (or a NaN) value in the weights. This leads to an unstable algorithm and is called an exploding gradient.On the other hand, the steps are too small and this leads to minimal changes in the weights and bias terms – even negligible changes at times. We thus might end up training a deep learning model with almost the same weights and biases each time and never reach the minimum error function. This is called the vanishing gradient.A point to note is that both these issues are specifically evident in Recurrent Neural Networks – so be prepared for follow-up questions on RNN!",explod gradient mean vanish
555,  What are the applications of transfer learning in Deep Learning?,"I am sure you would have a doubt as to why a relatively simple question was included in the Intermediate Level. The reason is the sheer volume of subsequent questions it can generate!The use of transfer learning has been one of the key milestones in deep learning. Training a large model on a huge dataset, and then using the final parameters on smaller simpler datasets has led to defining breakthroughs in the form of Pretrained Models. Be it Computer Vision or NLP, pretrained models have become the norm in research and in the industry.Some popular examples include BERT, ResNet, GPT-2, VGG-16, etc and many more.It is here that you can earn brownie points by pointing out specific examples/projects where you used these models and how you used them as well.It is not possible to discuss all of them, so here are a few resources to get started:It is here that questions become really specific to your projects or to what you have discussed in the interview before.Also, depending on the domain – with Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing, these questions can change. While it is not important to know the architecture of each model in detail, you would need to know the intuition behind them and why these models were needed in the first place.Again, just like the intermediate level, it is important to always bring in examples that you have studied or implemented yourself into the discussion.",applic deep learn learn transfer
556,  How backpropagation is different in RNN compared to ANN?,"In Recurrent Neural Networks, we have an additional loop at each node:This loop essentially includes a time component into the network as well. This helps in capturing sequential information from the data, which could not be possible in a generic artificial neural network.This is why the backpropagation in RNN is called Backpropagation through Time, as in backpropagation at each time step.You can find a detailed explanation of RNNs here: Fundamentals of Deep Learning – Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks.",ann backpropag compar differ rnn
557,  How does LSTM solve the vanishing gradient challenge?,"The LSTM model is considered a special case of RNNs. The problems of vanishing gradients and exploding gradients we saw earlier are a disadvantage while using the plain RNN model.In LSTMs, we add a forget gate, which is basically a memory unit that retains information that is retained across timesteps and discards the other information that is not needed. This also necessitates the need for input and output gates to include the results of the forget gate as well.",challeng gradient lstm solv vanish
558,  Why is GRU faster as compared to LSTM?,"As you can see, the LSTM model can become quite complex. In order to still retain the functionality of retaining information across time and yet not make a too complex model, we need GRUs.Basically, in GRUs, instead of having an additional Forget gate, we combine the input and Forget gates into a single Update Gate:It is this reduction in the number of gates that makes GRU less complex and faster than LSTM. You can learn about GRUs, LSTMs and other sequence models in detail here: Must-Read Tutorial to Learn Sequence Modeling & Attention Models.",compar faster gru lstm
559,  How is the transformer architecture better than RNN?,"Advancements in deep learning have made it possible to solve many tasks in Natural Language Processing. Networks/Sequence models like RNNs, LSTMs, etc. are specifically used for this purpose – so as to capture all possible information from a given sentence, or a paragraph. However, sequential processing comes with its caveats:This gave rise to the Transformer architecture. Transformers use what is called the attention mechanism. This basically means mapping dependencies between all the parts of a sentence.Here is an excellent article explaining transformers: How do Transformers Work in NLP?

It uses target value and output value to compute error derivative concerning output activations.

All these filters are initialized randomly. These filters then become our parameters which will be learned by the network subsequently. ReLU The ReLu layer is used with the convolutional layer. Pooling It reduces the spatial size of the representation to lower the number of parameters and computation in the network. This layer operates on each feature map independently. Full Collectedness Neurons in a completely connected layer have complete connections to all activations in the previous layer, as seen in regular Neural Networks. Their activations can be easily computed with a matrix multiplication followed by a bias offset. ",cnn differ layer

These are the artificial neural networks which are designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data such as handwriting, text, the spoken word, genomes, and numerical time series data. RNN use backpropagation algorithm for training because of their internal memory. RNN can remember important things about the input they received, which enables them to be very precise in predicting what's coming next.",rnn
605, What are the issues faced while training in Recurrent Networks?,"Recurrent Neural Network uses backpropagation algorithm for training, but it is applied on every timestamp. It is usually known as Back-propagation Through Time (BTT).There are two significant issues with Back-propagation, such as: Vanishing Gradient When we perform Back-propagation, the gradients tend to get smaller and smaller because we keep on moving backward in the Network. As a result, the neurons in the earlier layer learn very slowly if we compare it with the neurons in the later layers.Earlier layers are more valuable because they are responsible for learning and detecting simple patterns. They are the building blocks of the network. If they provide improper or inaccurate results, then how can we expect the next layers and complete network to perform nicely and provide accurate results. The training procedure tales long, and the prediction accuracy of the model decreases. Exploding Gradient Exploding gradients are the main problem when large error gradients accumulate. They provide result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training. Gradient Descent process works best when updates are small and controlled. When the magnitudes of the gradient accumulate, an unstable network is likely to occur. It can cause poor prediction of results or even a model that reports nothing useful.

Code The code layer is used to represent the compressed input which is fed to the decoder. Decoder The decoder layer decodes the encoded image back to its original dimension. The decoded image is a reduced reconstruction of the original image. It is automatically reconstructed from the latent space representation. ,autoencod briefli differ layer

In this case, the shop owner should be able to distinguish between fake and authentic wine.The forger will try different techniques to sell fake wine and make sure specific techniques go past the shop owner’s check. The shop owner would probably get some feedback from wine experts that some of the wine is not original. The owner would have to improve how he determines whether a wine is fake or authentic.The forger’s goal is to create wines that are indistinguishable from the authentic ones while the shop owner intends to tell if the wine is real or not accurately.Let us understand this example with the help of an image shown above.There is a noise vector coming into the forger who is generating fake wine.Here the forger acts as a Generator.The shop owner acts as a Discriminator.The Discriminator gets two inputs; one is the fake wine, while the other is the real authentic wine. The shop owner has to figure out whether it is real or fake.So, there are two primary components of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) named: Generator Discriminator The generator is a CNN that keeps keys producing images and is closer in appearance to the real images while the discriminator tries to determine the difference between real and fake images The ultimate aim is to make the discriminator learn to identify real and fake images.",adversari gener network

671,What is ‘Naive’ in a Naive Bayes?,"The Naive Bayes Algorithm is based on the Bayes Theorem. Bayes’ theorem describes the probability of  an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The Algorithm is ‘naive’ because it makes assumptions that may or may not turn out to be correct.",bay naiv naiv
672,Explain SVM algorithm in detail. ,"SVM stands for support vector machine, it is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used  for both Regression and Classification. If you have n features in your training data set, SVM tries to plot it in n-dimensional space with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. SVM uses hyperplanes to separate out different classes based on the provided kernel function. ",detail svm
673,What are the different kernels in SVM?,"There are four types of kernels in SVM. Linear Kernel, Polynomial kernel, Radial basis kernel, Sigmoid kernel.",differ kernel svm
674,Explain Decision Tree algorithm .,A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for Regression and  Classification. It breaks down a data set into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an  associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf  nodes. A decision tree can handle both categorical and numerical data. ,decis tree
675,What is pruning in Decision Tree?,"Pruning is a technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision  trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances. So, when we remove  sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning or opposite process of splitting. ",decis prune tree
676,What is logistic regression?,Logistic Regression often referred to as the logit model is a technique to predict the binary outcome from  a linear combination of predictor variables. ,logist regress
677, What Are the Drawbacks of the Linear Model? ,"Some drawbacks of the linear model are: The assumption of linearity of the errors,  It can’t be used for count outcomes or binary outcomes, There are overfitting problems that it can’t solve.",drawback linear
678, What is the difference between Regression and classification ML techniques?,"Both Regression and classification machine learning techniques come under Supervised machine  learning algorithms. In Supervised machine learning algorithm, we have to train the model using labelled  data set, While training we have to explicitly provide the correct labels and algorithm tries to learn the pattern  from input to output. If our labels are discrete values then it will a classification problem,",classif ml regress techniqu
679,What are Recommender Systems?,"Recommender Systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that are meant to predict the  preferences or ratings that a user would give to a product. Recommender systems are widely used in movies,  news, research articles, products, social tags, music, etc. ",recommend system
680, What is Collaborative filtering?,"The process of filtering used by most of the recommender systems to find patterns or information by  collaborating viewpoints, various data sources and multiple agents.",collabor filter
681,How can outlier values be treated?,"Outlier values can be identified by using univariate or any other graphical analysis method. If the number of  outlier values is few then they can be assessed individually but for a large number of outliers, the values can  be substituted with either the 99th or the 1st percentile values. All extreme values are not outlier values. The most common ways to treat outlier values. To change the value and bring it within a range. To just remove the value.",outlier treat valu
682," During analysis, how do you treat missing values?","The extent of the missing values is identified after identifying the variables with missing values. If any  patterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful  business insights. If there are no patterns identified, then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values  (imputation) or they can simply be ignored. Assigning a default value which can be mean, minimum or  maximum value. Getting into the data is important. If it is a categorical variable, the default value is assigned. The missing value is assigned a default value. If  you have a distribution of data coming, for normal distribution give the mean value. If 80% of the values for a variable are missing then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable  instead of treating the missing values.",analysi miss treat valu
683, What is Ensemble Learning?,Ensemble Learning is basically combining a diverse set of learners(Individual models) together to improvise  on the stability and predictive power of the model. ,ensembl learn

685,What is boosting?,"Boosting is an iterative technique which adjusts the weight of an observation based on the last  classification. If an observation was classified incorrectly, it tries to increase the weight of this observation  and vice versa. Boosting in general decreases the bias error and builds strong predictive models. However,  they may over fit on the training data. ",boost
686,What is a Box-Cox Transformation?,"The dependent variable for a regression analysis might not satisfy one or more assumptions of an ordinary  least squares regression. The residuals could either curve as the prediction increases or follow the skewed  distribution. In such scenarios, it is necessary to transform the response variable so that the data meets  the required assumptions. A Box cox transformation is a statistical technique to transform non-normal  dependent variables into a normal shape. If the given data is not normal then most of the statistical techniques assume normality. Applying a box cox transformation means that you can run a broader  number of tests.",box cox transform

690,How Are Weights Initialized in a Network?,"There are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly.Initializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer  perform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless. Initializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to  0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most  commonly used method. ",initi network weight
691,What Are Hyperparameters? ,"With neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A  hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a  network is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate,  epochs, etc.).",hyperparamet
692,What is Epoch?,It represent one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model). ,epoch
693,What is Batch?,"It refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we  divide the dataset into several batches.",batch
694,What are Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)?,"RNNs are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognise the pattern from the sequence of data  such as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc. To understand recurrent nets, first, you  have to understand the basics of feedforward nets. Both these networks RNN and feed-forward named after the way they channel information through a series  of mathematical orations performed at the nodes of the network. One feeds information through  straight(never touching the same node twice), while the other cycles it through a loop, and the latter are  called recurrent.",network neural recurr rnn
695,What Is a Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)?,"As in Neural Networks, MLPs have an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It has the  same structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can  classify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes. Except for the input layer, each node in the other  layers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the  activation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP  uses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network  calculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came  (adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately).",layer mlp multi perceptron
696,What is  exploding gradients?,"While training an RNN, if you see exponentially growing (very large) error gradients which accumulate  and result in very large updates to neural network model weights during training, they’re known as  exploding gradients. At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in  NaN values. This has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your training data. ",explod gradient
697,What is vanishing gradients? ,"While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small; this makes the training difficult. When the  slope is too small, the problem is known as a Vanishing Gradient. It leads to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy. ",gradient vanish

699,What is the role of the Activation Function?,The Activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the neural network helping it to learn more  complex function. Without which the neural network would be only able to learn linear function which is a  linear combination of its input data. An activation function is a function in an artificial neuron that delivers an  output based on inputs.,activ function role
700,What is an Auto-Encoder? ,"Auto-encoders are simple learning networks that aim to transform inputs into outputs with the minimum  possible error. This means that we want the output to be as close to input as possible. We add a couple of  layers between the input and the output, and the sizes of these layers are smaller than the input layer. The  auto-encoder receives unlabelled input which is then encoded to reconstruct the input. ",auto encod
701,What is a Boltzmann Machine?,Boltzmann machines have a simple learning algorithm that allows them to discover interesting features that  represent complex regularities in the training data. The Boltzmann machine is basically used to optimise the  weights and the quantity for the given problem. The learning algorithm is very slow in networks with many  layers of feature detectors. “Restricted Boltzmann Machines” algorithm has a single layer of feature  detectors which makes it faster than the rest.,boltzmann machin
702,What Is Dropout and Batch Normalization? ,Dropout is a technique of dropping out hidden and visible units of a network randomly to prevent overfitting  of data (typically dropping 20 per cent of the nodes). It doubles the number of iterations needed to converge  the network. ,batch dropout normal

Since data flows  in the form of a graph, it is also called a “DataFlow Graph.”",comput graph
706,What are dimensionality reduction and its benefits?,"Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of converting a data set with vast dimensions into data  with fewer dimensions (fields) to convey similar information concisely. This reduction helps in compressing data and reducing storage space. It also reduces computation time as  fewer dimensions lead to less computing. It removes redundant features; for example, there's no point in  storing a value in two different units (meters and inches). ",benefit dimension reduct
707,How can you select k for k-means?,"We use the elbow method to select k for k-means clustering. The idea of the elbow method is to run k means clustering on the data set where 'k' is the number of clusters.Within the sum of squares (WSS), it is defined as the sum of the squared distance between each member  of the cluster and its centroid.",k k mean select
